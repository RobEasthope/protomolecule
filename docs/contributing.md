#### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type:

```bash
feat!: migrate to new API structure

BREAKING CHANGE: The API structure has changed...
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(ui): add new Card component with hover effects"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(eslint-config): resolve TypeScript v5 parsing error"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update contributing guide with examples"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(ui)!: change Button API to use variant prop"
```

### 4. Add a Changeset

**Every PR that modifies packages must include a changeset:**

```bash
# Run the changeset CLI
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the packages you've changed
2. Choose the version bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a summary for the changelog

Example changeset file (`.changeset/fluffy-pandas-dance.md`):

```markdown
---
"@protomolecule/ui": minor
"@protomolecule/eslint-config": patch
---

feat(ui): add new Card component with animations

fix(eslint-config): update TypeScript parser configuration
```

**Important:** Never include the root package `"protomolecule"` in changesets. Only scoped packages (`@protomolecule/*`) should be versioned.

### 5. Run Quality Checks

Before pushing, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm format

# Type checking
pnpm build
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the PR template:
   - Clear title following conventional commits
   - Description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
4. Submit the PR

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format

PR titles should follow conventional commits:

import { Component } from './Component';

describe('Component', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<Component>Test</Component>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    // Test user interactions
  });

  it('should be accessible', () => {
    // Test accessibility
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Test edge cases
- Test error states
- Test accessibility

## Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Changesets** create version PRs
2. **Merge** triggers automatic release
3. **NPM** packages published automatically
4. **GitHub Releases** created with summaries

Maintainers handle the release process, but contributors should:

- Include changesets with PRs
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document breaking changes
